"emoji2vec.bin" is a crucial file for our code. Its source has been referenced in report.


Install the packages used :

pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost gensim tensorflow

To run the code:

python3 36.py


36.py contains code corresponding to methods giving the highest validation accuracies on respective datasets as mentioned in report.

To disable viewing epochs in terminal while running 36.py, do verbose=0 inplace of verbose=1 in 36.py for Dataset1 and Dataset3.

The current 4 files generated are wrt following validation accuracies :
Dataset 1 : 95.27%  (LSTM)
Dataset 2 : 98.36%  (Logistic Regression)
Dataset 3 : 85.69%  (GRU)
Dataset Combined :98.97%  (Logistic Regression)

Codes for other methods mentioned in report can be found in extras folder in their respective .ipynb files.
